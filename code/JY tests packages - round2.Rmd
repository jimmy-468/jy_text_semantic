This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

JYcomment: All documentation in place, easy to understand.

### Test run (of Sabinas package) 
Using sample code adapted from readme-file on GitHub  

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ImageFilter)
library(magick)
```


```{r}
#Load the image
#Assign the path to the image you want to use in the filter (replace with your file path or image name if in the working directory)
image_path <- "../grp_peers_files/outlook stockholm.jpg"
```
JYcomment: I first tried changing working directory as I saw there was some file ops going on in the code, then realized I could change path

```{r}
#Apply the chosen filter to your image
#Assign the filter function to an object to be able to print and save the image

#Grayscale filter
gray_image <- apply_grayscale_filter(image_path)
#View the final image
print(gray_image)
#Save the final image as a JPEG, change path to the name and location desired
image_write(gray_image, path = "../grp_peers_files/gray_image.jpg", format = "jpeg")
```
JYcomment: Worked fine. I see a greyscale image in the Viewer pane. Got file output.


```{r}
#Cutoff filter to the grayscale vector (requires the grayscale filter to have been run first) 
cutoff_image <- apply_cutoff_filter(image_path)
#View the final image
print(cutoff_image)
#Save the final image as a JPEG, change path to the name and location desired.
image_write(cutoff_image, path = "../grp_peers_files/cutoff_image.jpg", format = "jpeg")
```
JYcomment: Worked fine. I see a black-and-white image in the Viewer pane. Got file output.


```{r}
#Red, green or blue filter. Insert color "red", "blue" or "green" and change the output_path name. 
color_image <- apply_color_filter(image_path, color = "red")
#View the final image
print(color_image) 
#Save the final image as a JPEG, change path to the name and location desired.
image_write(color_image, path = "../grp_peers_files/color_image.jpg", format = "jpeg")
```
JYcomment: Worked fine. I see a red image in the Viewer pane. Got file output.


```{r}
#Any color filter, by supplying RGB values (any_color = c(0-255, 0-255, 0-255))
any_color_image <- apply_any_color_filter(image_path, any_color = c(255, 0, 255))
#View the final image
print(any_color_image)
#Save the final image as a JPEG, change path to the name and location desired.
image_write(any_color_image, path = "../grp_peers_files/any_color_image.jpg", format = "jpeg")
```
JYcomment: Worked fine. I see a magenta image in the Viewer pane. Got file output.


## Testing Fabians's package

```{r fabian1}
# Installing
library(devtools) # Make sure that the devtools library is loaded
install_github("https://github.com/AMindOfMetalAndWheels/SchleichExam1New.git")
```
JYcomment: Installation process already done previously, went smoothly

```{r fabian2}
# Activate and analyze package
# Use Ctrl + Enter to run individual lines of code
library(SchleichExam1New)

# access package documentation
packageDescription("SchleichExam1New")
help(package = "SchleichExam1New")

#list functions and datasets
ls("package:SchleichExam1New")

#list datasets in package
data(package = "SchleichExam1New")

# access functions documentation
?binary_window
?euclidean
?plot_euclidean_results
?process_euclidean_data
?smooth_window
```

JYcomment: All documentation in place. Instructions comprehensible.

### Test run (of Fabians package) 
Using sample code adapted from function help documentation

```{r fabian 3}
library(utils)
library(ggplot2)
library(testthat)
library(SchleichExam1New)
```

```{r}
test_check("SchleichExam1New")
```

JYcomment: it says "No test files found", probably no dataset. Not a problem, I just download it from the course webpage and modify the file-read code below:

```{r}
# Load data
my_data <- utils::read.csv('../grp_peers_files/Example_window.csv')
```

JYcomment: Worked fine, I see ```my_data``` as a df in Environment, 45573 obs of 5 vars.  
Next up, some data transforms it seems

```{r}
# change column name X to Index
names(my_data)[1]<-paste("Index")

# Change time column
my_data$time <- as.POSIXct(my_data$time)
#subset data set for faster test
my_data2 <- my_data[c(1:250), c(1:5)]
```
JYcomment: Ran w/o errors

```{r}
# Test euclidean
SchleichExam1Slide::euclidean(my_data)
# Store as data frame
euclidean_data <- SchleichExam1Slide::euclidean(my_data)
```
JYcomment: got an error, probably old package name, I change it below:
```{r}
# Test euclidean and Store as data frame
euclidean_data <- euclidean(my_data)
```
JYcomment: this chunk ran fine, I got a new df ```euclidean_data``` with dims [45573, 6]  
Since the old package name seems to persist in ensuing code, so I've modified them too

```{r}
# Apply smooth_window function on raw data and on euclidean
smooth_data <- smooth_window(my_data, window_size = 100)
smooth_euclidean_data <- smooth_window(euclidean_data, window_size = 100)
```
JYcomment: code ran fine but  ```smooth_window() ``` took about 5-10s

```{r}
# Apply binary_window function on raw data and on euclidean
binary_data <- binary_window(my_data, window_size = 100)
binary_euclidean_data <- binary_window(euclidean_data, window_size = 100)
binary__smooth_euclidean_data <- binary_window(smooth_euclidean_data, window_size = 100)
```
JYcomment: code ran fine, each function took about 5s

```{r}
# test the combination function
process_euclidean_data(my_data, window_size = 100)
my_ggplot_test <- process_euclidean_data(my_data, window_size = 1000)
```
JYcomment: code took about 10-20s, I got some empty output above, probably fine 
excited to see the result...

```{r}
# plot combination function
plot_euclidean_results(my_ggplot_test,include_mean = TRUE, include_binary = FALSE)
```
JYcomment: Yay! It worked! Graph looks awesome. It represents XYZ-acceleration as a acceleration-vector length (Euclidean) and a _smoothed_ curve of the Euclidian using sliding window method (Mean). One pecularity that I do not understand is why the baseline acceleration is almost never 0 but always around 1? Perhaps it is gravity...
